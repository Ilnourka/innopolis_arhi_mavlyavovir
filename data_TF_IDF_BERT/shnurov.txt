The sun'll come out
Tomorrow;
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow
There'll be sun!

Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow,
'Til there's none!

When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray
And lonely;
I just stick out my chin
And grin
And say: Oh........

The sun'll come out
Tomorrow;
So ya gotta hang on
'til tomorrow,
Come what may!

Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love ya tomorrow!
You're always
A day away!
