I love my books
They are the homes
of queens and fairies,
Knights and gnomes.

Each time I read I make a call
On some quaint person large or small,
Who welcomes me with hearty hand
And leads me through his wonderland.

Each book is like A city street
Along whose winding way I meet
New friends and old who laugh and sing
And take me off adventuring!
