Here is my little garden,
And some seeds I'm going to sow.
Here is my rake to rake the ground.
And here is my handy hoe.

Here is the big round yellow sun,
Our sun warms everything.
Here are the rain clouds in the sky,
The birds will start to sing.

Little plants will wake up soon,
And lift their sleepy heads.
The little plants will grow and grow,
From their warm earthy beds
