Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze

It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata!

When he was a young warthog
When I was a young warthog
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after ev'ry meal
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind

And, oh, the shame
Thought-a changin' my name
And I got downhearted
Everytime that I...
Hey, not in front of the Kids
Oh, sorry.
